### Overview

Are you a proprastinator struggling to decide on what task to do next from your todo list? Do you feel like choosing to do one task will make you lag behind in other tasks?

Well then, let this app take away the pressure of choice for you. Using this:
- You will manage to actually do tasks instead of constantly moping around the choice
- If the app selects a task, but you don't like it, you will automatically know which task you *actually* want to do, so you still get to do tasks anyway
